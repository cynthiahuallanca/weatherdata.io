## What's the Weather Like? 

 
Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. 
So let's take what about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: 

  **What's the weather like as we approach the equator?*

Now, I know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter..."_

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?


### Summary  
In the code inside, you'll find a sample of more than 500 cities taken randomly, with a range of latitude between (-90, 90) 
and longitude between (-180, 180). Using [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api) you'll see how Latitude correlates with temperature, humidity,
cloudiness and more. Also -thanks to [Pandas Matplot Lib](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html)- you'll be able to see this in different scarett plots. 

Finally, if you want to run the code by yourself (yei!) please obtain an API key from Weather Map API and add a config file in the same folder that your code.

Enjoy the ride!
